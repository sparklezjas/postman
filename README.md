This was my first project working with Express. I went through several frustrations while learning that were really great lessons! So, the instructional videos and information I used was out of date. This was frustrating because I had to basically look up things and hodge podge some code together and pray it worked. Well, it didn't! There were a lot of errors and I had to troubleshoot and debug like a coder. After working on it for several hours, I felt "surely, this code is right!" So, I reached out to another coder who looked at it and said it all looked good. You know what he suggested? Restarting my computer. Guess what? It worked. So, moral of the story - sometimes the very BASIC things in troubleshooting are the things that fix the issues. Never be too cool to go back to 101!
